  Would you love to improvise exactly what you hear in your head and finally get
  those sounds you've been looking for?

  Wanna know exactly how and where to use scales so it sounds like real music how to create solos for any song, and what riffs go with what chords?

Hi, my name is Claude Johnson. I've been playing and teaching guitar for over 25 years and I've helped over 4.3 million guitarists with my Guitar Control Newsletter and I've sold over half a million instructional DVDs in over dozen countries.

If you wanna improve your playing quickly, without years of practice or you want to play smokin solos with intense passion and total control then this is EXACTLY what you've been looking for.

If you're like I was when I first started working on my guitar playing, you're probably not as great as you'd like to be, yet. But don't worry...

## <!--StartFragment-->

## In The Beginning, I Sucked Too. But Then...

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

I tried all kinds of things like: *I took lessons, bought guitar magazines, I hung out with other guitarists, I jammed with the radio, but it just seemed like the improvements were slower than a drunk turtle.*

Deep inside, I was searching for the mystery answer that explained why legends like Santana and Clapton could make 2 or 3 notes sound more amazing than 100 mindless notes put together.

But, no one had the answer...

<!--EndFragment-->

## <!--StartFragment-->

## Then, One Day I Had Big "Ah-Ha" And It All Changed.

I realized that **if you play from the heart**, the technique is secondary. I'm not saying technique is not important, however I realized that legends like Clapton and Santana were using this concept.

The second part of the realization was: you don't need to play fast solos all the time. It's all about playing THE RIGHT NOTES. And that started me on the path to discovering what I call: Guitar Control Secrets.

After I tapped into this new guitar knowledge, I started rocking the house. I was one of the most intense guitar players in Philly – I was improvising all of my solos LIVE in the hottest bars and clubs like the Hard Rock Café.

And people were loving it...

I was so inspired by my new skills that I become obsessed with developing even more Guitar Control. I kept adding new elements to the system and kept tweaking it and refining it.

![](https://ws1.guitarcontrol.com/assets/images/cb-gc-santana.jpg)

Then, in 2005 I released **"Guitar Control Secrets"** and it has changed the lives of over 20,000 guitar players. I get emails every single day from guys that thank me for showing them "the missing link".

Here's an example...

<!--EndFragment-->

> ## <!--StartFragment-->
>
> ## I love your guitar control program!
>
> "Your playing is very good, and very natural. It is inspirational watching you play and then break down what you are thinking and how you're approaching it. As I said I have been playing for 16 years but have been stuck in a rut... playing the same scales, the same licks... it all just sounds the same . I have needed to get to the next level and get off this plateau and I think your program gives me an opportunity to do just that. Thanks very much Claude!"

### Here Are The 3 Critical Components Of Killer Guitar Control Secrets.

There are 3 critical components, that when you put together, will awaken the killer lead guitar player that's already within you.

These three components are:

1. Essential Technique,
2. Fretboard Knowledge, and the
3. "Brain-to-Hand" Connection.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

First, you need at least a **basic level of technique.** This is the most fundamental level of guitar training. And I will show you how you can boost your technique quickly.

The second component is **fretboard knowledge.** I'll show you how the entire neck connects together. After watching this course, you'll know how all the notes tie together into melodic and harmonic arrangements and patterns, and how to command the fretboard for song writing or improvising.

![](https://ws1.guitarcontrol.com/fasttrack/images/jon019.jpg)

There is a wealth of fretboard knowledge lying underneath every simple scale. The deeper your knowledge is, the greater your ability will be to create interesting melodies and solos. Wait until you learn some of my simple shortcuts to mastering the fretboard. They'll take years of your learning curve.

But then I dropped an atomic bomb when I reveal the third component...

### Is This The Greatest Guitar Secret Ever?

Yes, I am talking about the invisible X-factor that every guitar hero possesses.

**The brain-to-hand connection.**

This factor lets you totally maximize your expressive capability and control using the chops you already have.

Some pros call it **playing from the heart.** As far as I know, no one has ever decoded this before.

> "dude you rock. great instruction... i have been playing 30 yrs and you showed me some stuff i never figured out... i got so much out of the first DVD i'm saving the second one for later... understand i am a working musician... but your simplistic method has opened gigantic doors for me..."

~ Ken Hill, Moorpark, California

Don't worry if you're playing as great as you'd like it to be yet. Listen...

Virtually every guitar teacher out there teaches you techniques and that's cool. However, NO ONE is teaching you the guitar mindset, approach and paradigm of the legends and that's the missing link that you need.

And as soon as you learn it...

### Your Guitar Playing Is Going To Change... Fast.

I know that's a big claim, but I get emails everyday from guitar players telling me that my video made a huge difference with their guitar playing.

Here's another example:

 It's opening up a new world I never knew

> "Claude, Got the DVDs already! Very fast service! Have watched them through twice already. I think they're great. I like the way you are showing things just lke you are in the room w/ me. Some things are clear already that I never knew before. I think I can begin to play from the heart maybe someday soon. You seem like a very likeable real person, and I like you're "style" of playing and you seem to naturally play from the heart. I'm inspired to be much better than I am already from your dvds. Thanks so mucho. By the way, I just turned 60 and it is opening up a new world I never knew. Thanks again."

~ Michael Carman, McLouth, Kansas

### Learning This Secret Sent Shockwaves Through My Body. It Was Like A Stairway From Heaven Fell From The Sky.

I break down exactly how you can master the critical guitar ability. If you are serious about becoming a guitar legend, you HAVE TO KNOW THIS. The funny thing is, almost every guitar player overlooks this critical concept.

I'm super excited to share my most precious Guitar Control Secrets with you. I know it' what you've been secretly looking for and it's gonna completely change your guitar playing almost overnight.

This course called **"Killer Guitar Control Secrets"** reveals the fastest shortcuts possible to becoming a Guitar Legend.

### Is Guitar Playing Your Passion?

I've played tons of live gigs in my day, and let me tell you...

I'm in heaven when I'm on stage. Lost in the music. Especially when I'm improvising a wicked solo. To be honest, that's my heroin. Nothing jacks me up more than being able to play just what I feel in the moment.

Whether you're a raw beginner or a seasoned player, **"Killer Guitar Control Secrets"** will completely wrap how you approach playing. And I promise, it will **open wild doorways on the fretboard you never knew existed.**

You can say I've been obsessed with learning how to play really well WITHOUT spending hours every day practicing. I'm a normal guy who has life and I'm just not willing to spend hours a day working on boring exercises and learning brain-numbing theory.

And I've done it -- *I've cracked the code on maximizing the speed of your improvements without wasting time.*
