## What is Personal Finance?

Personal finance refers to the process of applying certain financial principles when it comes to formulating monetary decisions. It typically focuses on ensuring that individuals and families formulate sound monetary decisions by sticking to the underlying principles of finance. Personal finance also addresses the specific ways through which families and individuals acquire, save, spend and budget financial resources while taking into consideration the many financial risks and future events. If you are one of those who want to start to effectively plan for your personal finances, then be aware that there are a few financial products that you should take into account and these include banking products such as consumer loans, credit cards and savings and checking accounts and insurance and investment products such as life insurance, disability insurance, health insurance, mutual funds, bonds and stock market. Effective planning for your personal finances will also require you to participate in and monitor your retirement plans, income tax and social security benefits.

Personal finance also covers all financial activities and decisions of individuals including investing, mortgages, debt servicing, insurance, savings and budgeting. It involves the process of effectively analyzing your present financial condition and forecasting your financial needs in the future. Personal finance also requires you to spend time looking at how you manage your money and your future. It also covers aspects linked to creating a budget for emergency funds, setting your financial obligations and monitoring and controlling your spending.
