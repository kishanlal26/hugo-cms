description: Hi. Pat Flynn here. I’ve always believed in transparency on the web
  and so I am disclosing that I’ve included certain products and links to those
  products on this site that I will earn an affiliate commission for any
  purchases you make. My goal with the blog is to help educate you on the
  possibilities that exist for a blogger in practically any field, but please
  understand I am doing this as a for-profit business and, frankly, so should
  you with your site unless you have some charitable endeavor in mind.  The site
  has grown so big at this point that it is nearly impossible to go back through
  and list each and every program that I have an affiliate agreement with. Given
  this, you should assume that any links leading you to products or services are
  affiliate links that I will receive compensation from just to be safe. Having
  said that, there are millions of products and services on the web that relate
  to blogging and making money online. I only promote those products or services
  that I have investigated and truly feel deliver value to you. Examples would
  include the banners for BlueHost, Leadpages, and Create an App. I'm also an
  affiliate and advisor for companies such as Leadpages, Convertkit, and
  Samcart.  SmartPassiveIncome.com is also a participant in the Amazon Services
  LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a
  means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to
  Amazon.com.  Please note that I have not been given any free products,
  services or anything else by these companies in exchange for mentioning them
  on the site. The only consideration is in the form of affiliate commissions or
  compensation as an advisor for a few companies.  If you have any questions

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
